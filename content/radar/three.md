Alright, you have arrived at one of the many highlights of this newsletter, the recap!

Through this section, you can relive some of your favorite moments or have a taste of the fun you might have missed out on. (Don’t worry, we’re involving you).

**Okay, let’s get right into it!**

### Hacktoberfest

The semester kicked off with our own spin on **Hacktoberfest**, an open call for all GDG Babcock members to contribute to open-source projects, track their progress on a leaderboard and then get recognized.

It ran through the month of October (I mean, duh) and it’s safe to say that everyone pulled up with some of their best work. There were also two sessions that held on the first two days of the event, as a primer on what to do and expect from the program. The topics spoken on were open source contributions, what Hacktoberfest is, how to get involved, the methods to source for projects and a rundown on how exactly to contribute.

### Info Session (October 5th)

The info session followed right after on the 5th of October, where we came together for insights into the semester, along with the plans and goals our able organizers had in mind (Someone give a cheer for our organizers.)

The new and shiny **four-track structure** was also introduced at the session, namely:

- Software Development and Engineering
- Infrastructure and Security
- Data & AI
- Design & Management

Each of the four mentioned have a lead, who all gave a description of the track they headed and in turn, introduced their specialists.

### The DNA of Data (October 19th)

Soon after, the Data & AI track held **‘The DNA of Data: Understanding How Data Powers Intelligence’** - an event that sought to teach and explain how data works, and how it fuels the next big innovations. The speakers were our Data Engineering, Data Science, Data Analytics and Machine Learning specialists, respectively. It held on the 19th of October and delivered on everything it promised and more.

### Monthly Meetup (November 2nd)

On the 2nd of November we held our monthly meetup, a way for us to just take a break from the academic grind. It featured a very interesting interactive quiz and debate session, giveaways, a showcase of the projects that were built during Hacktoberfest, and rewards for the top contributors and of course, refreshments.

### Track Intros & KAGAN (November 9th)

Following right after on the 9th, the Software Development and Design & Management tracks held events to introduce their newly joined members to the inner workings of their respective tracks.

- **Software Development Track:** Frontend Web, Mobile Development, QA, Backend Systems, and Data Structures & Algorithms.
- **Design & Management Track:** Product Design, 2D Animation, Product Management, and Games & Interactive Media.

On the same day, we hosted the much anticipated **X space with KAGAN** (Yes, the one and only!), who spoke on the topic _‘From Idea to Impact: Building Brands and Products That Actually Matter’_. Questions were answered, doubts were resolved, amazing insights were shared, and all who attended were both challenged and motivated.

### Campus Meetup with Allstars NG (November 16th)

One of the highlights was the Campus Meetup, held in partnership with the **Allstars NG** team on the 16th of November. Our host was none other than the Regional Manager, Tonbra – a web3 marketer who made it his mission to make crypto education accessible to everyone. Several clips came out of the event and the timeline was buzzing. The Allstars team has since closed up that chapter and moved on to other things, but their impact remains indelible.

### DevFest Lagos

Woohoo, it’s coming to an end! Oh no, it’s coming to an end.

Pick whatever works for you, but to sunset this particular recap is our presence at **DevFest Lagos!** (yes, we were there). Don’t have to tell you that the energy was infectious, and it was an absolute blast.

You can tell we’ve had a very eventful semester and honestly we’re only just getting started, so stick with us because next year, **GDG Babcock** is bringing bigger, better things to you.

Till then!
