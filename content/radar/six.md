We’ve shared the highlights of the semester through our events, meetups, and milestones.

But beyond the flyers, photos, and recaps are the moments that truly mattered—the quiet wins, the overwhelming days, the courage it took to show up, and the growth that happened in between.

So we decided to pause and listen. To hear the semester not from a timeline or a schedule, but from the people who lived it.

The heart of our community—**you**.

We asked members of GDG Babcock to look back and tell us, in their own words, what this semester felt like to them.

Here’s what they had to say.

### “HOW WAS THIS SEMESTER FOR YOU?”

> “This semester is my last first semester and I got to do a lot of things I never did since I got to this school, I made myself attend all events hosted in school provided it didn't clash with school work and I ended up singing at the Allstars x GDG Babcock event and I'm so happy that I got to do that, 100 level me would have had a heart attack if she heard I did this.”

> “This semester was pretty stressful! I had three-hour classes for the first time in my years in this school, but I’m just thankful! For the people I’ve met, especially in GDG and my department.”
>

> “Just one word, Omo”

> “All I can say is, though I'm still new here, I am really happy I picked this institution, even with its ups and downs, I've learnt a lot academically and spiritually.”
>
> — **Vincent**, _Computer Science, 100_

> “It's the most fun in the least draining way possible! Met amazing people and tied who I want to be my forevers closer. Really put myself out there and got really uncomfortable, which is what warrants growth.”

> “Looking back now, this semester has been so wonderful. My first day here, I made a lot of friends. Then I joined this wonderful community, and I’m so happy it was open to all students. For my academics, I don’t like 7 am classes. In my opinion, it should be illegal. Assignments and practicals every day are so exhausting. I participated in a lot of events and joined various clubs that I normally wouldn’t even think about. I’m happy for this new chapter in my life and can’t wait to see where it takes me”.

> “This semester is my second year in the school, transferred from another university last year, and so I just started to socialize with regular students. Joined GDG this semester because I needed something different from the usual routine, and um…it’s been a very enjoyable ride. It has exposed me to a lot of stuff too and a nudge towards my career path”
