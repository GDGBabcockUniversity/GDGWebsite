I was going through my Spotify Wrapped earlier this month when I came across my “listening archives”.
They decided I needed to remember the biggest days of my music. And I did.
I remembered the songs I was obsessed with, the thoughts I thought, even the weather.

It was the same on other apps, some for the very first time.
The end of the year is always reflective like that. You’ll definitely be comparing your last New Year's resolution to all you did in the year. And you’ll be wondering in what way life got better.

I don’t want to write about self-development, though. It’s something more important.

In my first year, I was given a web development project that I had zero ability to do. I think that was one of the first times I was worried about my education. But I’d met someone earlier, the smart friends you keep as academic assets. He practically did the whole assignment for me. I’ll never forget that.

A friend of mine and others started this tutorial group. They would share course materials and give us practice questions to prepare. I remember not studying for GEDS courses and somehow still getting a good grade because I crammed the answers to some practice questions that were magically set.

I know I speak for hundreds of students when I say we would be in deep, deep holes of misery and failure if not for them.

Just a week ago from my writing this, I took part in a Secret Santa gifting. Apparently, my secret Santa was a friend of mine, and he got me a lovely book that just happened to be on my reading list. After, a friend asked me if I remembered when they asked what I’d want as a gift and revealed how they’d planned the whole thing. Another friend told me how she’d “captured my moment” of squealing and hugging him when I got the gift. It was a highlight of my year.

**Why am I sharing all of this?**
For a lot of us, when we outgrow the fairytales and “magic” tied to this holiday, it loses its meaning and significance. Christmas feels like any other day. New Year’s is just January. Sparkly-eyed youth comes to an end, and it doesn’t matter anymore.

But I realized that I could choose to remember.

Much more than the gifts we receive on Christmas, I choose to remember how much I’ve been blessed throughout the year. And I celebrate my Lord’s birth as the very start of the promised redemption I now get to live in; redemption I got to experience all through January to December, and will continue to experience in the new year.

I’m not the only one who feels this way. The team asked GDG Babcock what Christmas means to them, and this is what they had to say.
