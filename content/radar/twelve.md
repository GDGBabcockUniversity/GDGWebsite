May this season bring you rest, joy, and renewed clarity.

Thank you for being part of this community and for showing up, in big and small ways, all year long.

Have a beautiful holiday, and we can’t wait to build more with you in the year ahead.

See you in our next RADAR issue. _wink wink_

With love,

**Commit & Push,**
