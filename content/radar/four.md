Yes, if you’re reading this, you know I relate to you. We are probably fighting the same battles.

I’m lying cross-legged on my roommate’s single bed, listening to _For My Hand_ by Burna and Ed Sheeran, and it’s rather ironic because I can’t relate to any of the lyrics — not when Babcock and my department have me bent over with the weight I’m carrying this semester.

I resumed with the intention of becoming an _academic weapon_, but honestly? I’m just fighting to survive at this point.

Give me your hands so I can put you on to how responsible use of AI has saved me this semester. The things that can save your GPA and mental health — legally, ethically, and without you being called to defend your paper:

### 1) AI is for Understanding Topics, Not Replacing Your Brain

I know — not stressing is more fun. But you still need to work out those brain muscles.

**Ask Chat (yes, that’s what I call it):**

> “Explain inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and encapsulation like I’m a curious ten-year-old. I’m new to this — break it down.”

No copying. No pasting. Just clarity. And now you understand the thing for real.

### 2) Use ChatGPT to Practice Exam Questions

Tell AI to generate exam-style questions from your coursework. This feature alone has saved my life more than once.

Then — _do the work_. Answer the questions yourself. After that, ask AI to grade your reasoning or point out what you missed.

This is where real learning happens.

### 3) Build an Effective & Realistic Study Plan (Girl, yes you can)

Sometimes the stress is not the work — it’s not knowing where to start.

**Ask AI:**

> “Make a weekly study plan based on these topics.”
> “Arrange this workload so I can finish without collapsing.”

AI will break your chaos into manageable slices. Suddenly the semester feels survivable again.

### 4) AI for Coding Help (Without Cheating)

Instead of: “Write the code for me.”

**Ask:**

> “Explain why my code is not running.”
> “Walk me through how to do this step-by-step.”

You still learn the logic, but without crying.

### 5) Use AI to Untangle Assignments (Not Write Them)

**Ask:**

> “Break this assignment into smaller tasks.”
> “What does this question actually mean?”

Understanding first makes everything else easier.

AI is a _study assistant_, not your _course rep_.
Use it to learn faster — not to break rules.

To be academic weapons, we can’t skip the work. We can only work smart.

If one thing is certain, it’s that I enjoy getting in this corner with you.
If you’re a Dave fan, you’ll understand when I say: _“We’re all alone in this together.”_

The New Year’s almost here — let’s get on our Zoom with motivation in our minds, knowing we’re not actually going through it alone. We have each other — a family, a community.

I see you…
