Behind every word, line of statement and piece, there’s a voice — a person.

This season, as we slow down for Christmas and look ahead to a new year, we wanted to introduce you to the people who make up our creative writing community beyond screens, submissions, and stand-ups.

A team of thinkers, dreamers, music lovers, night sleepers (or chronic sleepers), and individuals navigating school, life, and growth in their own way.

This is us — unfiltered, human, and learning as we go.

**Welcome to the faces behind RADAR.**

And that’s our team — different tastes, different stories, different coping mechanisms, but one shared journey.

What stands out isn’t just what we study or what we build, but **who we are while doing it**.

We manage pressure differently. We find meaning in different things. We recharge in our own ways.

And yet, we come together as a community driven by curiosity, growth, and the desire to build something meaningful and we hope that you enjoy this RADAR issue as much as we do!
