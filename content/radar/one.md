We often fear what we do not understand— whether it’s people, ideas, situations, or even technology. And honestly, that’s okay.

That’s part of why we’re here. So before you label that “techy innovation” as another means to further the agenda of the devil, stay with us for a moment.

Read on a bit. If you still feel the same after, no judgment (well… not in your face, at least).

_That was a joke. Probably._

But truly, spending a few minutes exploring the latest trends in tech has never hurt anyone. Or has it?

We haven’t heard of any such case, though if there is one, it might just be a skill issue.

**You can put your serious face on now. Cool stuff incoming...**
