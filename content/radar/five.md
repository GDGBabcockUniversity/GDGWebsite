_Siri, play “Wakanda” by Ludwig Göransson._

This is what I listen to every morning.

Sigh. Being a student of Babcock has its perks—perks you honestly can’t describe unless you’ve lived it yourself. It’s a mix of discipline, stress, vibes, and _inshallah_.

**Surviving 7 a.m. classes deserves a gold medal because it is not easy, forget it.**
Your body is screaming and begging for sleep, you’re rushing to get ready, telling your friend(s) to keep space for you, and somehow you still make it to class. Those mornings teach me a lot about discipline, whether I like it or not. I’ve learned to value my time better and be sharper with it.

**Hall worship and chapel seminar (who dug this pit for me?)**—very unnecessary but necessary, you dig?
Some days I wish not to attend, but at the back of my head there’s always that voice: “Go, or there will be trouble.”

**Food is a saga on its own. Why are the queues so long???**
And even after waiting that long, the food still manages to finish before you get to the front. So you either start another waiting cycle or buy something else. Most times, even the wait doesn’t pay. I will not be making any comments on the food, but we thank God.

### Then there’s the big boss: STRESS.

It comes like a thief—you won’t see it coming, but it will definitely find you.

As someone who struggles with anxiety, I honestly don’t know how to handle stress well. The pressure increases as you fight to keep your CGPA stable. Deadlines appear out of nowhere, group projects feel like you’re carrying the entire world on your shoulders, and the tension deepens as exams approach… alongside a lot of other things in between.

Being a BU student isn’t just about the degree. It’s about endurance, patience, discovering that life happens in phases, and realizing that you can, in fact, push through, survive, and grow as a human.
